        <p>An optical illusion is a visual phenomenon where the brain perceives something differently from reality. These illusions occur due to how our brain processes visual information.</p>
        <h2>Types of Optical Illusions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Literal Illusions:</strong> When the brain perceives an image that is different from the physical reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Physiological Illusions:</strong> Created by overstimulation of the brain with patterns, colors, or brightness.</li>
            <li><strong>Cognitive Illusions:</strong> When our perception is influenced by expectations and prior knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
